switch N with M and vice versa to maintain alphabetical order (mainly for differential manifolds' names)

decide a clear distinction between \id and \bigone

improve math environments with:
\begin{subequations} \label{eq}
	\begin{align}
		a &= b \label{subeq1} \\
		&= c \label{subeq2}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
